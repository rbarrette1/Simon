This is a Simon-like game (memory game) that was created for my Master's thesis. 

With this game, I conducted an experiment to see which interface changes (bold, spacing, etc...) seem 
to affect the user the most in terms of performance (time and errors) and cognitive load.

Created with Unity.

If this project is downloaded and opened in Unity, it will not work. The database which powered the 
application is no longer running. Also, a few folders were ommited due to GitHub's size 
limitation. Where repos cannot exceed 100 MB and 100 files in total.
